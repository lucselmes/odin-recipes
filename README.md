HTML for a recipe website

In this project we've applied a few HTML ideas:
- Linking and embedding images
- Using ordered and unordered lists
- Making portions of text bold or italicized
- Creating different paragraphs
- Linking different webpages between one another
- Linking a webpage to a different website

We've also practiced committing to git consistantly, 
and following the conventions for git commits.
